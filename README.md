# Mission Statement
Learning a new language from scratch is incredibly hard. Anki provides an easy and effective way to expand your vocabulary, and practice listening skills. Building an anki deck from scratch can be intimidating for someone who is new to the program, and new to language learning, but using a premade deck from the community may not have all the features you want and may feel impersonal.

**Super giga deck builder 9000** Provides a one stop shop for custom building a language deck with all the things you want. With **Super giga deck builder 9000** your able to pick _(or build)_ a word list, and create a card for each word picking from a list of pictures, and audio samples.

After building your deck you can download it as an anki file and use it in your anki program.
